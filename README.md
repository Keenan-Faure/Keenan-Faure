Hi, I am Keenan

[LinkedIn Link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenan-faure-84a604227/)

I am currently interested in growing to become an exceptional Full Stack Developer. To get an idea of my current programming knowledge and experience please visit my GitHub projects!

For the past 6 months I have been engaging in an online course at https://www.boot.dev which provides important steps on how to become a modern back-end developer. Through this course, despite having a BSC in Computer Science, I am able to identify and patch up many missing gaps in my back-end knowledge.

The experience of learning a brand new programming language, no matter how many times I experience it, is great. While you, of course, carry around your entire coding toolbox from programming language to language, it feel great when you are able to apply specific skills, that you excel at through lots of trail and errors, into a specific language. To me this was Golang. At first I was a PHP , Python faced programmer, but Golang threw that system away, and I am glad it did.

Since then, I have been enjoying the many perks that comes with Golang. I like that it has the ability to easily import Github golang modules into your project, along with the advantage that it's one of the fastest compiling languages created. I would love to see and write Golang code that is implemented and tested in a production environment!

In my free time I enjoy researching the below technologies and implementing in my projects:

- Kubernetes and their implementation inside Docker containers
- Docker Hub and the use of available Containers
- Advanced algorithms in Python (Heaps, Dijkstra, A* Search etc.)
- Learning Cryptography in Golang.
- ReactJS HTML Framework implementation.

I am constantly aiming to improve my skill set, currently I am experienced in the technologies below:

• GitHub version control using Git
• API Development and Design (Authentication with Basic and JWT, more coming soon...)
• Ngrok to expose local projects over the internet (for webhook POST requests etc.)
• Go (Programming Language)
• TDD (Test Driven Development)
• HTML5 (used as the front-end language in most back-end projects)
• CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
• JavaScript (creating responsive front-end application)
• Web Development
• PHP (Developing and Testing client custom code for Stock2Shop clients)
• SQL, database management & migration (with PostgresSQL and Goose)
• Python (Programming Language)
• Postman application (debug API Responses)
• XML data retrieval and manipulation.
• Putty (SSH)

I am grateful to the many people that taught me many of the skills that I have in my coding toolbox now.
